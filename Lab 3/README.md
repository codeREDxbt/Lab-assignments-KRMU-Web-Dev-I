# Lab 3 - Advanced Portfolio with Flexbox & Grid

This project is an enhancement of the Lab 2 portfolio, incorporating modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox and Grid), responsive design, and advanced styling.

## Description
The portfolio showcases my projects and skills as a Full Stack Developer. It is built using semantic HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on clean code and user experience.

### Key Features
- **Flexbox Layout**: Used for the navigation bar and hero section alignment.
- **CSS Grid**: Implemented for the Skills and Projects sections to create responsive card layouts.
- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop screens using media queries.
- **Animations**: Includes keyframe animations for the hero text and profile image, plus hover effects on cards and buttons.
- **Relative Units**: Used `rem`, `em`, `%`, `vw`, and `vh` for scalable sizing.

## Responsive Behavior & Testing
The website has been tested across different device breakpoints:

1.  **Desktop (> 768px)**:
    - Navigation links are visible.
    - Hero section displays text on the left and image on the right.
    - Skills grid displays 4 columns.
    - Projects grid adapts to available width.

2.  **Tablet/Mobile (< 768px)**:
    - Hero section stacks vertically (image below text).
    - Skills grid adjusts to 2 columns or 1 column depending on width.
    - Navigation adjusts spacing.

3.  **Small Mobile (< 480px)**:
    - Skills grid becomes a single column.
    - Layout is fully fluid.

## How to View
1.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
2.  Resize the browser window to see the layout adapt to different widths.
