# Capstone Project - Food Delivery App

**Theme:** Food Delivery App (LoveLotus)
**Student Name:** codeRED

## Description
This project is a fully responsive, static website for a fictional food delivery service named "LoveLotus". It demonstrates the use of semantic HTML5 and modern CSS3 techniques (Flexbox and Grid) to create a professional and user-friendly interface.

## Sections Implemented
1.  **Header/Navigation:** Sticky navigation bar with logo, links, cart icon, and login button.
2.  **Hero Section:** Large banner with a call-to-action and hero image placeholder.
3.  **Categories:** Grid layout displaying different food categories.
4.  **Menu Section:** A complex layout with a sidebar for filters (visual only) and a grid of food items.
5.  **Restaurants:** A section highlighting top-rated restaurants using card components.
6.  **Newsletter/Contact:** A subscription form to capture user emails.
7.  **Footer:** Contains quick links, social media icons, and copyright information.

## Layout Techniques & Responsiveness
-   **Flexbox:** Used for the header, navigation, hero alignment, and footer columns.
-   **CSS Grid:** Used for the categories, menu items, and restaurant cards to ensure a responsive grid layout.
-   **CSS Variables:** Defined in `:root` for consistent colors, fonts, and spacing.
-   **Media Queries:**
    -   **Desktop (≥1024px):** Full layout with sidebar and multi-column grids.
    -   **Tablet (~768px):** Hero section stacks vertically, sidebar is hidden (simulated mobile view), and grids adjust to fewer columns.
    -   **Mobile (≤480px):** Single-column layout for menu items and simplified grids for small screens.

## How to Run
1.  Clone the repository or download the `Capstone` folder.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  Resize the browser window to observe the responsive behavior.

## Visuals
-   **Fonts:** 'Poppins' from Google Fonts.
-   **Colors:** Primary Red (`#ff4757`), Dark Grey (`#2f3542`), and White.
-   **Animations:** Slide-in animation for hero text and fade-in for hero image.
